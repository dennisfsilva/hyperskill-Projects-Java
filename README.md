# Hyperskill Roadmap Projects ![Java](https://badges.aleen42.com/src/java.svg)![IDEA](https://badges.aleen42.com/src/idea.svg)

This repository serves as a portfolio of my programming proficiency, showcasing a curated selection of projects completed on JetBrains' Hyperskill platform, while learning Java. 

I'm following the [Java Developer](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/17) path.

Each project exemplifies my in-depth understanding and mastery of the Java programming language, and its various applications.

To improve readability, I will organize and present each project based on their level of complexity for clearer understanding.

## Important notes
* Each project has its own independent repository.
* Worth checking out ðŸ’Ž
